## Intro
<sup>1</sup>A styleguide is a set of standards for the writing and design of code. The implementation of a styleguide provides uniformity in code style and formatting, often covering guidelines regarding indentation, variable and function naming conventions, where best to apply whitespace and so on.

Following a consistent styleguide improves the overall quality of the code we write. This facilitates other developers stepping in to assist with maintenance more easily and can certainly save time in the long haul.

Consistently styled code can:
 - Reduce the lead time required to understand an implementation.
 - Make it easier to establish what code can be reused.
 - Clarify how updates to an implementation should be styled or structured.
